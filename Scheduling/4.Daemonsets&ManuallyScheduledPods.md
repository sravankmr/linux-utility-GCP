DaemonSets do not use a scheduler to deploy pods. It allows you to create pods across all the nodes, included the Master node. This is how the Kube-proxy and Flannel pods are created.

* Find the DaemonSet pods that exist in your kubeadm cluster

    `kubectl get pods -n kube-system -o wide`

* Delete a DaemonSet pod and see what happens

    `kubectl delete pods [pod_name] -n kube-system`

* Give the node a label to signify it has SSD

    `kubectl label node [node_name] disk=ssd`

* The YAML for a DaemonSet

```
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: DaemonSet
metadata:
  name: ssd-monitor
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: ssd-monitor
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: ssd-monitor
    spec:
      nodeSelector:
        disk: ssd
      containers:
      - name: main
        image: linuxacademycontent/ssd-monitor
```

* Create a DaemonSet from a YAML spec

    `kubectl create -f ssd-monitor.yaml`

* Label another node to specify it has SSD

    `kubectl label node YOURNODE disk=ssd`

* View the DaemonSet pods that have been deployed

    `kubectl get pods -o wide`

* Remove the label from a node and watch the DaemonSet pod terminate

    `kubectl label node YOURNODE disk-`

* Change the label on a node to change it to spinning disk

    `kubectl label node YOURNODE2 disk=hdd --overwrite`

* Pick the label to choose for your DaemonSet

    `kubectl get nodes YOURNODE2 --show-labels`
