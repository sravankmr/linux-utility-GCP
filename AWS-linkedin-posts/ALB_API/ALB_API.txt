Everyone says ALB is cheaper than API Gateway at scale.
That’s true… until it isn’t!

It's always important to consider the specific cost dimensions of a service.

At scale, services that charge by uptime (like ALB) are usually more cost-efficient than services that only charge for usage (like API Gateway).

For example, at 1000 TPS and a small payload (~1KB per request):
* ALB: ~$246/month
* API Gateway REST API: ~$9072/month
* API Gateway HTTP API: ~$2592/month

But what if you’re handling large payloads (e.g. 1MB per request)?

Well, one of ALB's cost dimensions is "Processed bytes". So the more data going through your load balancer, the higher the LCU (load-balancer capacity unit) units.

So, at an average of 1MB per request, ALB costs much more than API Gateway!

Always check which dimensions will drive your cost - uptime, request count, data processed, storage, etc.

The AWS Calculator (https://calculator.aws) exists for a reason, it can save you from a very expensive surprise later.

I honestly believe that so many costly mistakes in AWS can be avoided if we spend a little more time thinking through our solution and its costs.
