Everyone says ALB is cheaper than API Gateway at scale.
That’s true… until it isn’t!

It's always important to consider the specific cost dimensions of a service.

At scale, services that charge by uptime (like ALB) are usually more cost-efficient than services that only charge for usage (like API Gateway).

For example, at 1000 TPS and a small payload (~1KB per request):
* ALB: ~$246/month
* API Gateway REST API: ~$9072/month
* API Gateway HTTP API: ~$2592/month

But what if you’re handling large payloads (e.g. 1MB per request)?

Well, one of ALB's cost dimensions is "Processed bytes". So the more data going through your load balancer, the higher the LCU (load-balancer capacity unit) units.

So, at an average of 1MB per request, ALB costs much more than API Gateway!

Always check which dimensions will drive your cost - uptime, request count, data processed, storage, etc.

The AWS Calculator (https://calculator.aws) exists for a reason, it can save you from a very expensive surprise later.

I honestly believe that so many costly mistakes in AWS can be avoided if we spend a little more time thinking through our solution and its costs.

🚀 Smarter Deployments with AWS ALB Weighted Target Groups

One of my favorite features in the AWS Application Load Balancer is the ability to distribute traffic between multiple target groups using weights.

Instead of setting up complex routing logic or spinning up separate load balancers, you can simply assign traffic weights — for example:
 • 🟩 90% of requests to your production target group
 • 🟦 10% to your new version target group

That’s it, no DNS updates, no downtime, and you can adjust traffic distribution on the fly through the console, CLI, or Infrastructure-as-Code tools like Terraform or CloudFormation.

💡 Why it’s valuable:
 • Perfect for blue/green or canary deployments
 • Ideal for gradual migrations (e.g., EC2 → ECS/Fargate)
 • Helps teams test in production safely, with fast rollback if needed

This feature often flies under the radar, but it’s a game-changer for teams that want zero-downtime releases and controlled risk.

👉 Have you used ALB traffic weighting in your deployments?
I’d love to hear how it worked for you or what strategy you use for safe rollouts.
