💸 Plot twist: The "cheaper" option just cost me 37x more.

💡 "Let's use ALB — it's way cheaper than API Gateway at scale."

I almost hit "approve" on that architecture decision.
Then something made me pause: "Cheaper for WHO, exactly?"

Here's what could've happened:
Our use case: 1000 requests/second processing ~1MB vs ~1KB payloads (image uploads, document vs message, text transfers).
If I hadn't opened the AWS Calculator first, we would've walked straight into a trap.

ALB pricing looks attractive... until you see "Processed bytes"
At 1MB per request, those LCU units multiply FAST
What seemed like a cost-saving move would've cost us 37x more than API Gateway

That 15-minute calculation saved us from a very awkward conversation with finance.

The real lesson?

"Best practices" aren't universal. They're context-dependent.

Before blindly following "X is always cheaper than Y":

1️⃣ Open https://calculator.aws (it exists for a reason)
2️⃣ Plug in YOUR actual numbers — not generic benchmarks
3️⃣ Identify which cost dimension dominates: requests? bytes? uptime? storage?

For our scenario:
✅ API Gateway's per-request model = predictable costs
❌ ALB's byte-processing charges = bill shock waiting to happen

That said — ALB absolutely has its place.

For lower-payload, high-volume workloads, it's brilliant. And if you DO use it, don't overlook weighted target groups:

Deploy canary releases (90% stable, 10% new version)
Zero-downtime migrations between environments
Instant traffic adjustments without DNS changes

Just know your traffic profile first.

💬 To my fellow cloud architects: What's a "conventional wisdom" decision you almost made before the data said otherwise?

Sometimes the best architecture decisions are the ones we DON'T make. 👇

Everyone says ALB is cheaper than API Gateway at scale.
That’s true… until it isn’t!

It's always important to consider the specific cost dimensions of a service.

At scale, services that charge by uptime (like ALB) are usually more cost-efficient than services that only charge for usage (like API Gateway).

For example, at 1000 TPS and a small payload (~1KB per request):
* ALB: ~$246/month
* API Gateway REST API: ~$9072/month
* API Gateway HTTP API: ~$2592/month

But what if you’re handling large payloads (e.g. 1MB per request)?

Well, one of ALB's cost dimensions is "Processed bytes". So the more data going through your load balancer, the higher the LCU (load-balancer capacity unit) units.

So, at an average of 1MB per request, ALB costs much more than API Gateway!

Always check which dimensions will drive your cost - uptime, request count, data processed, storage, etc.

The AWS Calculator (https://calculator.aws) exists for a reason, it can save you from a very expensive surprise later.

I honestly believe that so many costly mistakes in AWS can be avoided if we spend a little more time thinking through our solution and its costs.

🚀 Smarter Deployments with AWS ALB Weighted Target Groups

One of my favorite features in the AWS Application Load Balancer is the ability to distribute traffic between multiple target groups using weights.

Instead of setting up complex routing logic or spinning up separate load balancers, you can simply assign traffic weights — for example:
 • 🟩 90% of requests to your production target group
 • 🟦 10% to your new version target group

That’s it, no DNS updates, no downtime, and you can adjust traffic distribution on the fly through the console, CLI, or Infrastructure-as-Code tools like Terraform or CloudFormation.

💡 Why it’s valuable:
 • Perfect for blue/green or canary deployments
 • Ideal for gradual migrations (e.g., EC2 → ECS/Fargate)
 • Helps teams test in production safely, with fast rollback if needed

This feature often flies under the radar, but it’s a game-changer for teams that want zero-downtime releases and controlled risk.

👉 Have you used ALB traffic weighting in your deployments?
I’d love to hear how it worked for you or what strategy you use for safe rollouts.
