AI is everywhere—it’s even in my toothbrush these days. But because the field changes so rapidly, it is hard to keep up with the terminology. 

Here are the top 7 AI terms you need to know to stay ahead:

1️⃣ Agentic AI
Unlike standard chatbots that respond to one prompt at a time,  AI agents can reason and act autonomously  to achieve complex goals. They operate in a loop: perceiving their environment, reasoning to find the best next steps, acting on a plan, and observing the results. 

2️⃣ Large Reasoning Models 
These are specialized LLMs fine-tuned to work through problems  step by step  rather than generating immediate responses. When a chatbot pauses to "think," it is using a reasoning model to create an  internal chain of thought  to break down complex tasks.

3️⃣  Vector Databases 
Instead of storing raw text or images as "blobs," these databases use embedding models to convert data into  vectors (long lists of numbers) . These vectors capture  semantic meaning , allowing the system to perform mathematical "similarity searches" to find related content.

4️⃣  RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) 
RAG uses vector databases to  enrich AI prompts  with external data. For example, if you ask about a company policy, a RAG system pulls the relevant section from an employee handbook to ensure the LLM provides an accurate, context-aware answer.

5️⃣  Model Context Protocol (MCP) 
MCP is a breakthrough that  standardizes how LLMs connect to external data sources  like email servers or code repositories. Instead of developers building unique connections for every new tool, MCP provides a universal way for AI to safely access your systems.

6️⃣  Mixture of Experts (MoE) 
MoE divides a massive model into  specialized neural subnetworks (experts) . At inference time, a routing mechanism only activates the specific experts needed for the task, allowing for  massive scaling without a proportional increase in compute costs .

7️⃣  ASI (Artificial Superintelligence) 
While AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) aims to match human-level cognitive tasks,  ASI is the theoretical next step . ASI systems would possess intelligence far beyond human levels and could potentially engage in  recursive self-improvement , redesigning and upgrading themselves in an endless cycle.

The AI landscape is moving fast—I could have listed 70 terms instead of just 7!.
