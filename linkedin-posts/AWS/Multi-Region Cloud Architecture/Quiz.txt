------------------------------------

The presentation describes an active-passive pattern where minimal infrastructure is deployed in the standby region, and compute resources are only scaled up during a failover. What is this pattern called?

A.
Pilot Light
Right answer
The Pilot Light pattern involves replicating data and having the core infrastructure configuration ready, but compute resources are launched and scaled out only when a failover is initiated.

B.
Regional Sharding

C.
Warm Standby
Not quite
A Warm Standby has a scaled-down but running version of the application ready, which is more than the minimal infrastructure described.

D.
Active Hot Standby

According to John Fermento, what is the most challenging part of implementing a multi-region architecture?

A.
Handling data synchronization and consistency.
That's right!
The speaker explicitly states that data is the most challenging part, referencing the CAP theorem and the trade-offs between consistency and availability.

B.
Deploying code simultaneously to both regions.

C.
Managing service quotas across regions.

D.
Choosing the correct failover mechanism.
