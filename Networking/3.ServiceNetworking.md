Services allow our pods to move around, get deleted, and replicate, all without having to manually keep track of their IP addresses in the cluster. This is accomplished by creating one gateway to distribute packets evenly across all pods.

### Types of Services

* **NodePort**: Exposes the Service on each Node’s IP at a static port (the NodePort). A ClusterIP Service, to which the NodePort Service routes, is automatically created. You’ll be able to contact the NodePort Service, from outside the cluster, by requesting <NodeIP>:<NodePort>.

* **ClusterIP**: Exposes the Service on a **cluster-internal IP**. Choosing this value makes the Service **only reachable from within the cluster**. This is the _default_ ServiceType.

* **LoadBalancer**: Exposes the Service externally using a cloud provider’s load balancer. NodePort and ClusterIP Services, to which the external load balancer routes, are automatically created.

* **ExternalName**: Maps the Service to the contents of the externalName field (e.g. foo.bar.example.com), by returning a CNAME record with its value. No proxying of any kind is set up.
