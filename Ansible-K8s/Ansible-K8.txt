🚀 Install and Bootstrap a High-Availability Kubernetes Cluster with Ansible

As a Platform Engineer, I wanted a fast, reproducible way to deploy a fully functional HA Kubernetes cluster across multiple VMs. No more manual setup or inconsistent environments—just one command to get everything running.
Using Ansible, I automated:
🔹 kubeadm init with controlled configuration (CIDRs, load balancer)
🔹 Automatic master & worker node joins
🔹 Core components: Cilium (CNI), Ingress-NGINX, Cert-Manager, OpenEBS
🔹 Local kubeconfig ready for kubectl and CI/CD pipelines

Why this matters:
✅ Fast, consistent HA clusters for dev & QA
✅ Standardized networking, ingress, certificates, and storage
✅ Idempotent and re-runnable—safe to redeploy anytime
✅ Simplified onboarding: one doc + one command

This setup drastically reduces lead time for new environments while keeping everything predictable and versioned.
